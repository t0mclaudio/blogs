# Web Developer

## Description

I am responsible for managing and developing the platform Etours is operating on. Etours platform includes the website the clients visit to view and book our Tour Packages. As the primary source of bookings that drives revenue to the business, I make sure that the website is accessible, user friendly, and works as expected. The Etours platform is an ecosystem of proprietary applications and third party vendor apps aimed to increase productivity and operational efficiency. I make sure that these seamlessly integrate together to form a single business process unit. To make this happen, I continually reconfigure our systemsâ€™ architecture to accommodate new features. Part of this effort is migrating our system from a traditional single server architecture to a multi-tier server-less architecture. This shift will allow us the flexibility and speed to add new services, efficient use of computing resources, and ability to handle growth when there is demand.
