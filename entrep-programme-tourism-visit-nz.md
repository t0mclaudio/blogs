### Please explain what you are currently doing in your career.

I am using my software development skills to develop new products and services for our business. I evaluate new software services, frameworks, libraries, and utilities that may be assembled to create market-driving opportunities for our business. I'm developing software applications that I hope will be useful to stakeholders in the tourism industry. These projects are based on my experience and observations as a tour operator for the past 10 years. Through these services, I wish to help those who need tools to increase their productivity and income.
 
### What do you consider your most important professional achievement to date and why?

I still consider the development of our information system as my most important achievement to date. It is composed of our proprietary software applications such as Content Management System, Quick Pricing System, Reservation/Booking System, and third-party applications assembled to form a business unit. 

About 90% of our revenue funnels through this system.

I learned a lot from building the system. Not only was I able to navigate through the technical complexity in building computer systems, but I also recognized units that can positively disrupt the tourism industry.

Through our platform, we were able to provide business to our business partners and livelihood to tourism front liners and communities. Somehow, it validated my efforts and inspired me to continue to build upon the success.

### What are your future business aspirations?

I want to take our business to be a leader of e-tourism services in the industry. This is to build on top of lessons learned and opportunities discovered when I developed our information system. I hope to open up new and untapped markets through these efforts.

### How do you think your visit to New Zealand can help with your business goals?

I expect my visit to New Zealand to be a learning experience where I will discover new things and broaden my horizon on the industry. I believe I will grow from this trip, make new connections, new perspectives, and gain a broader range of conceptions about the industry.

The experience will allow me to create innovative products and services that are sensitive to the issues of our society today. And more important, bring new business to New Zealand and my country.

### Where did you study and what is your professional background?

In 2004, I finished my bachelorâ€™s degree in Business Administration major in Computer Applications at De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde in Manila. I started my career as a graphic/web designer and out of necessity taught myself programming using different mediums.

In 2009, I co-founded a tour operations company with my wife. Having studied system analysis and design in college, I knew that system automation can increase our productivity and be a business advantage. Since then, I was mainly involved in building our information system.

In 2012, I took up a Master's in Information Technology at Ateneo de Davao University but dropped out after one semester because it did not satisfy my desire for a thorough study on computing. 

In 2017, I finished my two-year post-graduate diploma in Computer Science at the University of the Philippines and got the education I wanted on computer systems.
