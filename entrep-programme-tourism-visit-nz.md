1. Please explain what you are currently doing in your career.

I am using my software development skills to develop new products and services for our business. I evaluate new software services, frameworks, libraries, and utilities that may be assembled to create market-driving opportunities for our business. I'm developing software applications that I hope will be useful to stakeholders in the tourism industry. These projects are based on my experience and observations as a tour operator for the past 10 years. Through these services, I wish to help those who need tools to increase their productivity and income.
 
2. What do you consider your most important professional achievement to date and why?

I still consider the development of our information system as my most important achievement to date. It is composed of our proprietary software applications such as Content Management System, Quick Pricing System, Reservation/Booking System, and third-party applications assembled to form a business unit. 

About 90% of our revenue funnels through this system.

I learned a lot from building the system. Not only was I able to navigate through the technical complexity in building computer systems, but I also recognized units that can positively disrupt the tourism industry.

Through our platform, we were able to provide business to our business partners and livelihood to tourism front liners and communities. Somehow, it validated my efforts and inspired me to continue to build upon the success.

3. What are your future business aspirations?

I want to take our business to be a leader of e-tourism services in the industry. This is to build on top of lessons learned and opportunities discovered when I developed our information system. I hope to open up new and untapped markets through these efforts.

4. How do you think your visit to New Zealand can help with your business goals?

Aside from familiarising myself with New Zealand travel products and services, I want to learn by observing best practices New Zealand tourism players are doing in terms of environment, gender equality, and other social issues that affects or a product of the whole tourism industry. I want to connect and learn from other entrepreneurs about their perspective on where the industry is going.

5. Where did you study and what is your professional background?

I finished my bachelorâ€™s degree in Business Administration major in Computer Applications at De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde in Manila, Philippines in 2004. After graduation, I started my career as a graphic /web designer. In 2009, I co-founded JTC Travel and Tours with my wife when we saw an opportunity in the educational tour sector. In 2012, we incorporated the business as Etours Davao Inc, which I would be the President and my wife as the vice-president. While I act in the capacity of a general manager, most of the time I work as a software developer in our small business.
